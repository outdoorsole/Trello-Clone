## Overview
To-Do-ulate (word play on "Tabulate") was created as a learning project based on Trello, an existing free web product management tool created by Avram Joel Spolsky. Trello allows individuals and groups to organize projects, lists and tasks in a visual way, using a kanban model to display and set up the process.


This project was built using MEAN (a fullstack JavaScript framework), which includes several pre-packaged bundled modules for building applications.
